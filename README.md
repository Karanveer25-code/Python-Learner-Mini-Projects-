Python Mini Projects
Welcome to my collection of Python mini projects!
This repository is a personal learning space where I build small and fun projects to strengthen my Python skills.
Each project is designed to practice different concepts like functions, loops, file handling, OOP, and working with external libraries.

📌 What's Inside
You'll find a variety of bite-sized Python projects, such as:

    🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
    
    🧮 Simple Calculator
    
    🔢 Random Passward Generator

    💰 Bid Game



🛠 Tech Used

    Python 3.x
    
    Standard Libraries
    
    Some third-party modules (details in each project folder)



📚 Learning Goals

    Improve problem-solving skills
    
    Understand basic to intermediate Python concepts
    
    Practice clean code and file organization
    
    Get comfortable with Git and GitHub

🌱 Still Growing...

I'm continuously adding new projects as I explore more of Python.
Feel free to fork this repo, try the projects yourself, or even suggest new ideas!
